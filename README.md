# Mathematical expression parser and simulator

Simulates the expression by transforming its infix to postfix form using [Shunting-yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) instead of passing by AST.

Supports only Integer numbers, parenthesis, addition, substraction, multiplication, division

## Quick start

```terminal
$java ExpressionParser.java && javac ExpressionParser
